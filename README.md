# üé≤ BoardGameNight

BoardGameNight is a full-stack web application designed to help users organize and manage board game nights with friends. Users can browse a list of games, manage their own collection, create public or private game night events, and send invitations to friends.

This project demonstrates a complete PERN-stack application, featuring a React frontend that communicates with a Python/Flask API backend, all deployed on Render.

**Frontend:** https://gamenight-tcpy.onrender.com/

**Backend API:** https://gamenight-backend-a56o.onrender.com/

**Please Note:** The backend is hosted on Render's free service. If it has been inactive, it may take 30-60 seconds to "wake up" and respond to the first request. Please be patient on the initial load!

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user signup, login, and logout functionality. Sessions are maintained across browser restarts.

- **Friend Management:** Users can send, accept, and decline friend requests to build their social circle.

- **Game Browse:** View a list of available board games. Logged-in users can add new games to the public list.

- **Event Creation:** Host new game nights, setting them as either public (visible to all) or private (details hidden from non-invitees).

- **Invitation System:** Hosts can invite their friends to game nights. Invitees can then accept or decline these invitations.

- **Privacy Control:** Details for private events (like location and host) are automatically hidden from users who have not been invited and accepted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>/server
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the local database:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

5. Seed the database with sample data (optional):
```bash
python seed.py
```

6. Run the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5555.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd ../client 
```
(Assuming your React app is in a folder named client)

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will now be running on http://localhost:3000 and will be configured to communicate with your local backend.
